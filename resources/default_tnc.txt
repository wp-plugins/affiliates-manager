Once you have signed up for the Affiliate Program, you will be assigned a unique Affiliate Code. You are permitted to place links, banners, or other graphics we provide with your Affiliate Code on your site, in your emails, or in other communications. We will provide you with guidelines, link styles, and graphical artwork to use in linking to <strong>[site name]</strong>. We may change the design of the artwork at any time without notice, but we won't change the dimensions of the images without proper notice.

To permit accurate tracking, reporting, and referral fee accrual, we will provide you with special link formats to be used in all links between your site and the <strong>[site name]</strong>. You must ensure that each of the links between your site and the <strong>[site name]</strong> properly utilizes such special link formats. Links to the <strong>[site name]</strong> placed on your site pursuant to this Agreement and which properly utilize such special link formats are referred to as "Special Links." You will earn referral fees only with respect to sales on a <strong>[site name]</strong> product occurring directly through Special Links; we will not be liable to you with respect to any failure by you or someone you refer to use Special Links or incorrectly type your Affiliate Code, including to the extent that such failure may result in any reduction of amounts that would otherwise be paid to you pursuant to this Agreement.

Affiliate links should point to the page of the product being promoted.

<h2>Referral fees/commissions and payment</h2>
For a Product sale to be eligible to earn a referral fee, the customer must click-through a Special Link from your site, email, or other communications to <strong>[site url]</strong> and complete an order for a product during that session. The session ends once someone closes their web browser, navigates away from the <strong>[site url]</strong>, or otherwise leaves <strong>[site url]</strong> without ordering a product before leaving the site. If they leave the site, come back later on their own, and then purchase a product, you will not earn a commission.

We will only pay commissions on links that are automatically tracked and reported by our systems. We will not pay commissions if someone says they purchased or someone says they entered a referral code if it was not tracked by our system. We can only pay commissions on business generated through properly formatted special links that were automatically tracked by our systems.

We reserve the right to disqualify commissions earned through fraudulent, illegal, or overly aggressive, questionable sales or marketing methods.

Payments only begin once you've earned more than <strong>$[payout minimum]</strong> in affiliate income.
